As a student you have to submit a lot of tasks
for your lectures. Usually the only reply you
get is that you passed or failed. This is a situation
we want to change.
Feedbacksystem is an application to automatically check
your submissions and give an immediate result.
With the result we want to provide suggestions
to the students about their mistakes, 
collect the most common mistakes and
present them to the lecturers such that they
can address them in the lectures.
